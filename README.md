# Bank Marketing Dataset Classification

This project involves building a classification model using the Bank Marketing Dataset. The model is built using a Decision Tree Classifier and the process is documented in the Jupyter Notebook `task3.ipynb`.

## Overview

The notebook `task3.ipynb` contains the following sections:

1. **Importing Libraries and Loading Dataset**: This section involves importing necessary Python libraries and loading the Bank Marketing Dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In this section, we perform an initial investigation on the data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: This section includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and converting binary variables to numerical format.

4. **Model Training**: The preprocessed data is split into training and testing sets. A Decision Tree Classifier is trained on the training set.

5. **Model Evaluation**: After training the model, its performance is evaluated using accuracy as the evaluation metric.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: This section involves using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for the Decision Tree Classifier.

7. **Model Visualization**: The decision tree model is visualized in this section.

8. **Conclusion**: This section provides a summary of the entire notebook and the insights gained from the Bank Marketing Dataset.

## Usage

To use this project, clone the repository and open `task3.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed (as listed in the first section of the notebook).
